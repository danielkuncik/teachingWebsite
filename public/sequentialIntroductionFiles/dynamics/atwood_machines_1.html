    <h3 class = 'sectionTitle'>What are Atwood Machines?</h3>

    <p>
        An Atwood machine is a device designed to test Newton's Laws.
        It consists of two different masses hanging from a pulley.
    </p>

    <p>
        In part 1, we will understand the Atwood Machine as a  full system.

        <h5 class = 'wordForDefinition'>Force of Gravity (Weight)</h5>
        <p>
            Force of gravity = Mass * Free-Fall Acceleration
            <br>
            On planet earth, free fall acceleration is equal to 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
