<h3>
    Some Information
</h3>
<p>
    There are three different things we are trying to figure out here:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The UNIX Operating System
        </li>
        <li>
            The Python Console
        </li>
        <li>
            Writing and Running Python in the Text Editor
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>Continued Intro to UNIX</h4>
        <p>
            UNIX based operating systems are the operating systems most commonly used in programming!
            And, for that reason, we need to know how to operate such a system if we are going to solve
            physics programming challenges.
            And the only way to get good at it is to play around and test it out!
        </p>

        <h3>
            Here are some more commands to test out:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>date</code>: What does this do?
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>whoami</code>: What does this do?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some things you need to be able to do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Make a new directory, enter that directory, then delete that directory.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make a new file. Use the <code>ls</code> command to confirm the file was made!
            </li>
            <li>
                Make a new file, copy the file, then use the <code>ls</code> command to confirm you have two copies of it!
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Finally, we need to work on openning and closing the <strong>Python Console</strong>.
            You know that you are hte the unix operating system when the command line ends with a
            dollar sign <code>$</code>.
            You are in the <strong>Python Console</strong> when the command line is <code> >>> </code>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Practice opening and closing the Python Console.
                Type <code>python</code> to open and <code>exit()</code> to close!
                Make sure you always know which one you are in, that's important!
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Lists</h4>
        <p>
            To learn about lists and arrays, we are going to use the <strong>Python Console</strong>.
            Open up the <strong>Python Console</strong> by entering the command <code>python</code> in UNIX.
        </p>

        <p>First, make a list, and show that you made a list....</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <code> >>>myList = [1,2,3]</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code> >>>print(myList)</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code> >>>type(myList)</code>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Then, reading your list piece by piece</p>


        <p>After that, 'et's try changing parts of your list:</p>


        <p>Then, let's try adding elements to your list...</p>
