<h3>Significant Errors:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Please read the directions.
            There were directions listed on how to fill out the <i>Useful Application</i>,
            <i>How to Calculate</i>, and <i>Why is it a Vector?</i>
            sections.
            Use the directions and examples given to help fill out these sections.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many students also had completed sections that were not required.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            It is unacceptable to submit documents that are, word for word, identical to a friends.
            This is not a simple homework assignment but is an essay
            assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sections labeled <i>definition</i>, <i>equation definition</i>, <i>vector or scalar</i>,
            and <i>algebraic symbol</i> can be derived from a resource and cited.
            But the sections labeled <i>Useful Application</i>, <i>How to Calculate</i>, and <i>Why is it a Vector?</i>
            are asking for your original ideas.
            Your original ideas should not be identical to another student and certainly should not be the same,
            word for word statements as another student.
        </p>
        <p>
            On future submissions, your answers to these sections should not be identical
            to any other students.
            If you put significant thought and creativity into coming up with ideas,
            it would be extremely unlikely this would happen by chance.
        </p>

    To make a table cell that spans multiple rows in Microsoft Word,
    highlight the cells you want to merge and
    click the <strong>merge</strong> button.

<h3>More Specific Errors</h3>
<p>
    This is a list of common errors made by many students.
</p>
<p>
    Because this is a <i>kinematics</i> dictionary, the definitions should
    all be based on the idea of motion.
    Thus, your definition for distance should not be "How far apart two objects are,"
    because this does not define distance as it relates to <i>motion</i>.
    Pick a different way to define distance that is connected to how something moves
</p>
<p>
    For how to calculate distance, the formula distance = speed * time is not a general
    method because it applies only if speed is constant.
    Instead, adapt one of the problems on calculating distance we completed in class.
