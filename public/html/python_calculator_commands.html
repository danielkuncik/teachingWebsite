<h4>
    Three new Python Calculator Commands
</h4>

<p>
    In order to effectively use python as a calculator,
    you need to understand the following three commands.
</p>

<h5>
    Integers vs. Floats
</h5>

<p>
    In python, <strong>integer</strong> values and <strong>floating point</strong>
    values are treated differently.
    An integer is just like an integer in math class. Examples of integers are:
    <code>
        <br>
        5
        <br>
        -8
        <br>
        100
        <br>
        -90
        <br>
    </code>
    A floating point value is like a decimal number in math class. Examples of floating point values are:
    <code>
        <br>
        8.0
        <br>
        6.7231
        <br>
        -10.0
        <br>
        -6.7821
        <br>
    </code>
    Floating point values and integer values are different types of computer variables
    that will be treated differently in python!
    The most obvious differnce comes when you try to divide two values.
