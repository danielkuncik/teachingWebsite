<h3>
    Coding assignments 3!
</h3>


<h4>
    New Commands
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>float()</code>: Converts a number into a floating point value.
        Necessary for correctly dividing two numbers in a function, if you want an accurate decimal result
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>import math</code>: Used as the first line of your program. Allows you to use a library of
        mathematical operations in your program.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>math.sqrt()</code>: takes the square root of a number
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>round()</code>: Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.
        The command takes two arguments. The first argument is a number, and the second is the number of decimal
        places you must round it to.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is a good idea, before completing the assignment, to test out these new functions!
    Go into the <i>python console</i> by typing <code>python</code> in any terminal.
    There, you can type any of these commands to test how they work!
</p>

<h4>
    Part 4: Calculator Operations:
</h4>

<p>
    Create a file in the <code>finished_assignments</code> folder called
    <code>physics_functions.py</code>. All of the functions in this program should be run from this lesson.
    The first line of your file should be <code>import math</code>.
    This will allow you to use the <code>math.sqrt()</code> function throughout the file.
</p>

<p>
    The goal of these assignments is to work on using Python as a calculator effectively.

    All of the functions you will create are simple applications of physics formulas.

    All functions should return answers rounded to two decimal places!
</p>
<p>
    You can use the test commands that I wrote to help test that your file works!
    However, after checking that these commands, work, you should delete them!
    In the end, your file should have only the <code>import math</code> statement,
    then five functions defined.
</p>


<p>
    $$ GPE = mgh $$
    Use \( g = 9.81 \text{m}/\text{s}^2 \)
    $$ \Delta x = v_i (\Delta t) + \frac{1}{2} a (\Delta t)^2 $$
    $$ V = IR $$
    $$ a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{\Delta t} $$
    $$ KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 $$
</p>

<h4>
    Part 1: Make these functions
</h4>

<ol start = '8'>
    <li>
        Create a function entitled <code>get_gpe(mass, height)</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a function entitled <code>get_displacement(initial_velocity, acceleration, change_in_time)</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a function entitled <code>get_current(voltage, resistance)</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a function entitled <code>get_acceleration(final_velocity, initial_velocity, change_in_time).</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a function entitled <code>get_velocity_from_ke(kinetic_energy, mass)</code>.
        This function will return the value of velocity by solving the kinetic energy equation!
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>
    Part 2: Test the functions
</h4>

<p>
    To make sure each of your functions work properly,
    conduct the following tests.
    All values should be returned to two decimal places.
    The values should <i>exactly</i> as they are here.
    In order to efficiently run these tests, you can <strong>copy and paste</strong> these lines of code
    into your program, and if they succeed, you can then delete them.
    <code>
        <br><br><br>
        print("If every number is exactly equal to the test value, you win!")
        <br>
        print("Otherwise you need to change something.")
        <br>
        print(str(get_gpe(4, 6)) + " => 235.44") # should return 235.44
        <br>
        print(str(get_gpe(88.12, 5.1232)) + " => 4428.79") # should return 4428.79
        <br>
        print(str(get_gpe(345, 12.56)) + " => 42508.69")  # should return 42508.69
        <br>
        print(str(get_displacement(1, 2, 3)) + " => 12.0")  # should return 12.0
        <br>
        print(str(get_displacement(4.56, 21.23, 9.42)) + " => 984.89")  # should return 984.89
        <br>
        print(str(get_displacement(5.67, 1, 3)) + " => 21.51")  # should return 21.51
        <br>
        print(str(get_current(8, 2)) + " => 4.0")  # should return 4.0
        <br>
        print(str(get_current(6.78, 21.39)) + " => 0.32")  # should return 0.32
        <br>
        print(str(get_current(10, 9)) + "=> 1.11")  # should return 1.11
        <br>
        print(str(get_current(3, 10)) + " => 0.3")  # should return 0.3
        <br>
        print(str(get_acceleration(5, 2, 3)) + " => 1.0")  # should return 1.0
        <br>
        print(str(get_acceleration(10, 2, 5)) + " => 1.6")  # should return 1.6
        <br>
        print(str(get_acceleration(12, 8, 8)) + " => 0.5")  # should return 0.5
        <br>
        print(str(get_acceleration(3.45, 8.12, 0.12)) + " => -38.92")  # should return -38.92
        <br>
        print(str(get_velocity_from_ke(100, 10)) + " => 4.47")  # should return 4.47
        <br>
        print(str(get_velocity_from_ke(80, 1.6)) + " => 10.0")  # should return 10.0
        <br>
        print(str(get_velocity_from_ke(800, 6)) + " => 16.33")  # should return 16.33
        <br>
        print(str(get_velocity_from_ke(241.512, 7.89)) + " => 7.82")  # should return 7.82
        <br>
        print("Once the program is successful, delete these lines!")
        <br><br><br>
    </code>

</p>

<p>
    When you complete testing the assignment, and everything works well, your program should
    include the <code>import math</code> line, five defined functions, and nothing else.
</p>

<p>
    I will test these functions by running a series of commands.
    I will run them from the <strong>terminal</strong>
    in your <strong>workspace</strong> folder.
    If your folders are not organized exactly as indicated
    and your files are not named exactly as indicated,
    the programs will not work!
