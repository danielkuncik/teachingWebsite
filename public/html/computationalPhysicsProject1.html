<h1>Kinematics Project: Automatic Kinematic Graphs</h1>

<h3>Requirements:</h3>

<p>
    Create a <code>class</code> entitled <code>kinematicsSituation</code>.
    The <code>kinematicsSituation</code> class should have three initial variables:
    <code>initialPosition</code>, <code>initialVelocity</code>, and <code>acceleration</code>.
    These three variables represent the three constant values within any one dimensional kinematics situation.
    The variables <code>initialPosition</code> and <code>initialVelocity</code> initial variables
    are numbers representing the position
    and velocity of the object at time = 0.
    The <code>acceleration</code> initial variable
    is a number that represents the acceleration, which is constant in the
    kinematics situation we are considering.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>kinematicsSituation</code> class should have three methods,
    <code>drawPositionTimeGraph</code>,
    <code>drawVelocityTimeGraph</code>,
    and <code>drawAccelerationTimeGraph</code>.
    These three methods should each draw a the selected kinematic graph
    and output it onto a <code>.png</code> file.
    Each method should take three arguments <code>timeMin</code>, <code>timeMax</code>, and <code>filename</code>.
    The arguments <code>timeMin</code> and <code>timeMax</code> are numbers representing the range of time that
    will be drawn in the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs.
    The <code>filename</code> argument is a string that gives the name of the file onto which the graph will be outputted.
    The output graphs must be well drawn and contain the correct labels on x-axis and y-axis.
</p>

<p>
    Note that this problem deals with only one-dimensional situations with a constant acceleration.
    (Extensions into multi-dimensional or stepwise acceleration will be included in future projects.)
</p>

<h3>Applications of the Project:</h3>

<p>
    Use the Python Class you have created to create kinematic graphs representing common situations.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        A car accelerates at a rate of 3 m/s<sup>2</sup> from rest for a time of 5 seconds.
        Draw position, velocity, and acceleration graphs for the car.
    </li>
    <li>
        You drop a rock off of a roof from rest and it strikes the ground 2 seconds later.
        Create position, velocity, and acceleration graphs for the rock.
        [The initial height of the rock is 19.6 meters.]
    </li>
    <li>
        A car moves at a constant velocity of 18 m/s for a time of 8 seconds.
        Create position, velocity, and acceleration graphs for the car.
    </li>
    <li>
        A person sits at the origin and does nothing for 10 seconds.
        Create position, velocity, and acceleration graphs for the person.
    </li>
    <li>
        A car beginning from a position 50 m to the LEFT of the origin
        approaches with a speed of 15 m/s.
        It comes to rest at the origin 5 seconds later.
        Create position, velocity, and acceleration graphs for the person.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Note that the goal is only to create a class which meets the requirements above,
    and it is okay to test each of these applications from within your code.
    You do not need to create an API (application program interface) to go with the Python class you created.
    (If you are interested in web design, that might be a good side project,
    but for a physics class we are going to focus primarily on solving the problems.)
