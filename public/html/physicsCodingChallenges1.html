<h3>
    Physics Coding Challenges 1: Creating Functions
</h3>
<p>
    This document contains a series of challenges
    to help you learn how to model
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The physics formula for acceleration is
        $$
        a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{\Delta t}
        $$
        Write a function named <code>find_acceleration</code>
        that takes as arguments <code>initial_velocity</code>,
        <code>final_velocity</code>, and <code>time</code>.
        <br>
        <code>
            find_acceleration(final_velocity, initial_velocity, time)
        </code>
        <br>
        If your function works well, you should be able to plug in
        the following values and fidn the following results:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>
                    find_acceleration(10,2,2) # should return 4
                </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>
                    find_acceleration(2,10,2) # should return -4
                </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>
                    find_acceleration(20,3,5) # should return 3.6
                </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>
                    find_acceleration(0,0,0) # should return an error
                </code>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            One likely problem you might have:
            If all of the variables entered are integers,
            then python will use <strong>integer division</strong>,
            in which is cuts off the remainder in any division problem.
            To sovle this problem, convert all inputs of your function to
            floating point values with the following commands:
            <br>
            <code>
                final_velocity = float(final_velocity)
            </code>
            <br>
            <code>
                intial_velocity = float(initial_velocity)
            </code>
            <br>
            <code>
                time = float(time)
            </code>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Example Momentum Problem:
        A cannon of mass \( M_c \) fires a cannonball of mass \( m_b \).
        Before the explosion, the cannon and cannonball are both
        stationary, afterwards the cannonball begins moving forward at a
        speed of \( v_b \). Determine the velocity of the cannon
        after the collision \( v_c \) in terms of \( M_c \), \( m_b \), and \( v_b \).
        Note that you should receive a negative value (assuming \( v_b \) is positive)!
    </li>
    <li>
        Write a function to find the recoil speed of a cannon after it fires a cannonball:
        <br>
        <code>
            find_recoil_speed(mass_of_cannon, mass_of_cannonball, velocity_of_shot)
        </code>
        <br>
        Note that, because you are attempting to find recoil <i>speed</i>, not velocity,
        the answer you return should be positive!
        <br>
        Test your function with the following examples:
        <ul>
            <code>
                find_recoil_speed(100,10,20)  # should return 2
            </code>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <code>
                find_recoil_speed(1,1,1)  # should return 1
            </code>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <code>
                find_recoil_speed(50.67,2.48,44.9)  # should return 2.19759226
            </code>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Evil Knievel drives his motorcycle horizontally off of a cliff.
        His motorcycle is moving at a horizontal speed of \( v_x \),
        and the cliff has a height of \( h \).
        Free-fall acceleration is given by \( g \).
        a) Determine an equation for the time before Knievel strikes
        the ground in terms of \( h \), and \( g \).
        b) Determine how far Knievel travels on his motorcycle
        before striking the ground in terms of \( v_x \), \( h \), and \( g \).
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a function to determine the horizontal distance traveled when
        something is lunached horizontally launched off of a cliff
        of height h.
        Call your function
        <code>
            find_horizontal_range(horizontal_speed, height, free_fall_acceleration)
        </code>
        Test your function with the following tests:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>
                    find_horizontal_range(1,1,1) # should return 1.14
                </code>
                <code>
                    find_horizontal_range(20, 40, 9.81) # should return 560.3
                </code>
                <code>
                    find_horizontal_range(3.56, 8.12, 4.32) # should return 29.8
                </code>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Two cars get into a car crash.
        The first car has a mass of \( m_A \) and a velocity before
        the collision of \( v_A \).
        The second car has a mass of \( m_B \) and a velocity before
        the collision of \( v_B \).
        After the collision, the two cars stick together (this is called a
        <i>totally inelastic collision</i>).
        The two cars combined have a velocity of \( v_f \).
        <br>
        Derive a formula for \( v_f \) in terms of \(m_A\), \(m_B\), \(v_A\), and \(v_B\).
        <br>
        Something to think about:
        are the cars necessarily going the same direction (a rear-end)?
        Could they be traveling in opposite directions (a head-on collision)?
        How could either possibility be represented in the formula.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a function that calculates the final velocity
        of two cars in a pefectly inelastic collision.
        <code>
            find_final_velocity(mass_a, mass_b, intial_velocity_A, initial_velocity_B)
        </code>
        Test your code with the following examples:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>
                    find_final_velocity(1,1,1,1) # should return 1
                </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>
                    find_final_velocity(10,15,6,-5) # should return 0.2
                </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>
                    find_final_velocity(8.2,4.9,-1.2,3.2) # should return 0.446
                </code>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Again, you may have problems if all of the inputs are <strong>integers</strong>
            and you are doing division, because Python will cut off any remainders or decimals!
            To fix this problem, use <code>mass_a = float(mass_a)</code>, and likewise
            for all of your inputted values.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>


<h4>
    A special extra challenge for football fans:
</h4>
<p>
    Create a function which calculates the passer rating of a quarterback!
    Note: this doesn't really have much to do with physics,
    but it requires precisely the same sorts of analytical
    and programming skills as solving phyiscs problems.
</p>
<p>
    You can look up how to calculate a passer rating in this
    <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating'>
        Wikipedia article
    </a>.
</p>
<p>
    If you think that you have successfully created a function that calcualtes passer rating,
    test it by plugging in some of <a href = 'https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BradTo00.htm'>Tom Brady's passing statistics</a>.
