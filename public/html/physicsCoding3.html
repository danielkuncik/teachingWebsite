<h3>
    Physics Coding 3: Introduction to Numpy
</h3>
<p>
    In the previous lesson, we made lists and graphed functions using Python Lists and For loops.
    This is a very useful skill to have, one of the fundamental skills for programming.
    But for <i>scientific computing</i>, modeling scientific situations on a computer,
    a much more commonly used way to make functions is with a package called <strong>Numpy</strong>.
    Numpy makes simple and easy to read code that we can use to solve complex scientific problems!
