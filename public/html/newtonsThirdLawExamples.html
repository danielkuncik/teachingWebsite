<h3>
    Three Videos Showing Newton's Third Law
</h3>

<div class = 'videoDiv'>
    <h4>
        WWI Artillery Video
    </h4>
    <p>
        This video is taken from the dated but still excellent documentary <strong>The Great War</strong> on WWI.
        World War One was a  artillery based war: most of the war was conducted by troops stationed far
        apart from each other firing artillery shells on a near continuous basis.
        As such, we have many great archival videos of such artillery shells being released.
        Whenever a shell is released, what happens to the cannon that launched it? Why?

    <h4>Space Shuttle</h4>
    <p>
        A rocket engine works by blasting hot fuel <i>downward</i>, which exerts a very strong <i>upward</i>
        force on the rocket.

    <h4>Super Mario and Yoshi</h4>
    <p>
        The 90s video game Super Mario World is full of great examples of Newton's Third Law.
        For example, if Mario jumps on a Koopa Troopa, the force exerted back on him pushes him up.
        In the following video, what happens when Mario and Yoshi exert a downward force on one of the saws?
        But towards the end of the video is a far more controversial example:
        When Mario exerts a downward force on Yoshi, what happens to Mario (and what happens to Yoshi?)
    </p>

    <h4>EVE and WALL-E</h4>
    <p>
        In this beautiful PIXAR scene, EVE and WALL-E dance in space.
        This video combines good examples of of Newton's Third Law and Newton's First Law.
        The First Law states that if an object is already in motion, it will remain in motion
        if no other force acts on it.
        Because WALL-E is in space, n the absence of forces such as air-resistance,
        friction, or downward gravity, any small motion by WALL-E will continue indefinitely until
        he somehow exerts another force.

        How is WALL-E able to exert force on himself? How is this related to Newton's Third Law?
    </p>

    <p>
        Really good physics point to notice: at about 0:30, WALL-E stops himself from moving by exerting a
        force in the direction <i>opposite</i> his own motion.
