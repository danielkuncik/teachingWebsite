<h1>Welcome to Physics Coding!</h1>
<h3>Why are we coding in physics?</h3>
<p>
    Because real scientists don't just solve problems on pen and paper!
    Almost all scientists these days are spending a considerable portion of time writing
    computer code.
    Almost all the problems that people would want to sovle today require it.
    For example, we've solved many problems that involve a car moving at a constant acceleration.
    Imagine now you have a rocket ship taking off. Is its acceleration constant? Certainly not.
    How many different equations and calculations do you think you need to explain the motion of a rocket taking off?
    Thousands, if not millions or billions! Humans can't do that many equations at once, but what can? A computer!
    That's why real scientists today do so many of their calculations by writing a computer program.

<h3>
    What are the particulars?
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Language: Python
    </li>
    <li>
        IDE: <a href = 'https://c9.io/login'>Cloud9</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    We are going to be using a programming language called Python.
    Python is one of the most popular languages in the world today.
    It is the most commonly used in scientific computing (which is what we are doing)
    and one of the top five in software development (by companies like Google, Apple, and Amazon).
</p>
<p>
    Every programmer needs an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which is a program that combines
    unix terminals, text editors, visual representations of the file tree, and often some other features.
    We are going to use an online, Cloud Computing IDE called Cloud9.
    Essentially , when you log into Cloud9 you are using another computer somewhere on the internet.
    For now, it is free for students.
    This also means it is completely online, so you can log into your files from any computer, anywhere in the world.

        <h4>
            Get Familiar with the Cloud 9 Interface
        </h4>
        <img src = '../../../playground/cloud9_screenshot.png' width = '600px' height = 'auto'>
        <p>
            The three most important parts of the cloud 9 interface for you to understand are the
            terminal, the text editor, and the file system.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <strong>file system</strong> is probably what will come most intuitively to you, as it
                works similarly to a MacOSX or Windows file system.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <strong>text editor</strong> is where you write programs that will accomplish what you need.
                Try typing something totally random in the text editor right now!
            </li>
            <li>
                The <strong>terminal</strong> is where you direct the entire operation. It is where you can create new files
                or directories, read files, run a console for a programming language, access a database, download data from
                the internet, etc. etc.
                The terminal runs using an operating system called Unix.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            Very Basic Unix BASH Commands
        </h4>
        <p>
            Computer programmers frequently use an operating system called Unix.
            Your Cloud9 computer, which you are currently accessing, is a unix computer.
            Unlike operating systems like Windows or MacOSX, you need to use typed commands to work with a unix system.
            In this case, you enter Unix commands and reiceve the output in the terminal area of the Cloud 9 interface.
            The type of UNIX you are using is also called BASH.
            Try out each of the following commands!
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>pwd</code>: "Print Working Directory" prints what directory you are currently.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>ls</code>: "List" lists everything in the directory you are currently in.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>mkdir</code>: "Make Directory" Makes a new directory. A directory is just like a file in Windows or MacOSX.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>cd</code>: "Change directory" Changes what directory you are working in.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>cd ..</code> : This changes to the directory one above where you are in the file tree.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>cd ~ </code>: this returns to your home directory (where you started).
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>rm</code>: "Remove" gets rid of a file
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>rmdir</code>: "Remove Directory" gets rid of a directory
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>clear</code>: clears your terminal screen
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            See if you can use these commands to do the following!
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make a new directory called "physics_problems."</li>
            <li>Use "ls" to confirm that you made it. It should be in the list.</li>
            <li>Go into that directory.</li>
            <li>Use pwd to confirm you are in the physics_problems directory.</li>
            <li>use "cd .." to go back.</li>
            <li>Keep using "cd .." to go back farther into the root directory. Every time you use it, use "pwd" and "ls" to see what's going on!</li>
            <li>Return to your home directory.</li>
            <li>Delete the "phyiscs_problems" directory.</li>
            <li>Use "ls" to confirm that it's gone.</li>
            <li>Use "clear" so that you have a nice, clear terminal screen.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If you have any interest at all in any career that involves coding and program,
            it behooves you to become as comfortable as possible with unix commands.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Running The Python Console and generating a "Hello World" program.
        </h4>
        <p>
            We will be coding using a programming language called <strong>Python</strong>.
            Python is the most commonly used langauge for scientific computing!
            Scientific computing just means solving scientific problems by computing, which is what we are going to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            To begin running Python, we are going to use the <strong>Python Console</strong>.
            The console allows you to enter commands and immediately get a result, as opposed to the more common
            method of coding in which you write several lines of code (we are going to do that also!).
        </p>
        <p>
            To start running the Python console, type <code>python</code> into your terminal and click enter.
            You will know you are inside because you see a <code> >>> </code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before doing anything else, know how to exit the Python Console, so you don't get trapped inside!
            To exit, just type <br>
            <code>exit()</code> <br>
            Before doing anything else, exit and reenter. That way, you know you're in control of where you are!
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenver someone is learning a new computer language, the first thing they do is create
            a <i>Hello World Program</i>. The program is one that simply prints the words "Hello World!"
            to the screen. You can create a Hello World Program in python by typing the following line:
            <br>
            <code>print('Hello World!')</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Or, you can try it with anything else you want to say. Note that youse can use double quotes or single qoutes,
            but it doesn't work if you have no quotes.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>print('hello physics class')</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>print("Brady is the GOAT")</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>print("The capital of Maine is Augusta")</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>print(hello mr kuncik)</code> This returns an error! Why?
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Bonus Question:
            <br>
            <code>print('Hello it's me. I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet.')</code>
            <br>
            This code returns an error. What's wrong? How can you fix it?
        </p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            Using Python as a Calculator
        </h4>
        <p>
            To practice with how Python works, try typing the following commands into the console.
            what happens with each of them? Was it what you expected?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>2 + 2</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>4 * 5</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>30 - 80</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>5 + 8 * 6</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>4 / 2</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>5 / 3</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>(4 + 6)/2</code>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here's some other things you should know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                For an exponent, you need to use two mulitplcation signs <code>**</code>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>2**4</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>5**2</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                For more advanced mathematical functions, you need to use a Math package.
                First type <code>import math</code>, then you have a whole new setup of functions to run
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>math.sqrt(9)</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>math.sqrt(144)</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>math.pi</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>math.sin(math.pi / 2)</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>math.tan(math.pi / 4)</code> (That's an interesting result. What might have happend?)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>math.acos(0.5) / math.pi</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You can try these and many more! To see all of the options under <code>math</code>,
                    try entering <code>dir(math)</code>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You can also read help pages on pretty much any function,
                    for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>math.gamma --help</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    brings you to a page explaining how to use the gama function in Python.
                    To exit this page, click <code>q</code>.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            Running programs from files
        </h4>
        <p>
            Exit the console by typing <code>exit()</code>.
            The console is great for playing around and trying out new functions,
            but to make serious programs we need to make them in separate text files and then run them.
            You'll make your first real program that runs from a file and run it.
            It'll be another "Hello World!" program.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Create a new file called <code>my_first_program.py</code>. You can do this by right-clicking in the File System.
                But a better way is to make the file on the command line.
                Make sure you have exited the Python console and are back onto your UNIX command line.
                Make sure you are in the correct directory. Then type:
                <code>touch my_first_program.py</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Open up your program in the <strong>text editor</strong> by finding it an clicking on it
                in the <strong>file system</strong>. It should be a blank text file to begin.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the file type <code>print('Hello World!')</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                On your UNIX command line, in the <strong>terminal</strong>, make sure you are in the same directory
                as your my_first_program.py file.
                Then, type <code>python my_first_program.py</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                If you see <code>Hello World!</code> (or whatever else you printed)
                in your terminal, you did it right. Congratulations!

                Use this formula to create a function that finds displacement. Name your function like this:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>def findDisplacement(changeInTime, initialVelocity, acceleration):</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a pen and paper, solve the formula above for acceleration.
                Then, create the following function:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>def findAcceleration(changeInTime, Displacement, initialVelocity):</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
