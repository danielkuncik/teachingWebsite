    <title>Intro to Projectile Motion</title>

<!--
Steps to this:
1 - describing in words and motion maps what occurs
2 - describing using kinematic equations what occurs
3 - describing using kinematic graphs what occurs
4 - describing what occurs dynamically, with free-body diagrams
5 - functional kinematic and dynamic analysis

And the different situations:
- falling down
- pop-up
- horizontal launch
-

should i just use the papers i made last year??
